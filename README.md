# Sokobond_JS
My latest programming project is a Java Script recreation of an amazing puzzle game Sokobond. I highly recommend the original. The author has given permission to use a few of the puzzle boards, but my dream is for people to create and share their own puzzles. 
Play a few levels of Sokobond for free and see that it is worth every penny to buy the original!

I have made a basic graphical puzzle editor to assist the manual string editor.
I also intend to try and create an algoritm to generate puzzles. That should be fun.

It is written in JS. There are no JS libraries used. I am using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) for the images.

I still use tables, as they work better than pure DIV / CSS on game grids. CSS, pthuey!

It is running live at:
